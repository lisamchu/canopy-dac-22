## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r data import}
data <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lisamchu/canopy-dac-22/master/canopy-dac-2022/data/Final%20Canopy%20Dataset%20for%20DAC%20-%20Final%20Data%203_22.csv")

leader_diversity <- data$confidential_leadership_team_diversity
teacher_diversity <- data$confidential_teaching_staff_diversity

# creates table with counts of diversity breakdowns
leader_counts <- data %>% count(confidential_leadership_team_diversity)
teacher_counts <- data %>% count(confidential_teaching_staff_diversity)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r bar charts}
leader_table <- table(leader_diversity)
teacher_table <- table(teacher_diversity)

# creates bar chart of leadership diversity distribution
leader_barplot <- barplot(leader_table, main="Racial/ethnic Breakdown of Canopy School Leadership Teams",
        xlab="Percentage Breakdown", ylab="Number of Schools",
        names.arg=c("0%", "0-24%", "25-49%", "50-74%", "75-100%", "Not sure", "Prefer not to say"))
# adds frequency for each distribution
text(leader_barplot, labels=leader_counts$n, pos=3, cex=1)

# creates bar chart of teacher diversity distribution
teacher_barplot <- barplot(teacher_table, main="Racial/ethnic breakdown of Canopy school teaching teams",
        xlab="Percentage Breakdown", ylab="Number of Schools",
        names.arg=c("0%", "0-24%", "25-49%", "50-74%", "75-100%", "Prefer not to say"))
# adds frequency for each distribution
text(teacher_barplot, labels=teacher_counts$n, pos=3)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
