## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r data import}
data <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lisamchu/canopy-dac-22/master/canopy-dac-2022/data/Final%20Canopy%20Dataset%20for%20DAC%20-%20Final%20Data%203_22.csv")

leader_diversity <- data$confidential_leadership_team_diversity
teacher_diversity <- data$confidential_teaching_staff_diversity
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r bar charts}
leader_table <- table(leader_diversity)
teacher_table <- table(teacher_diversity)

barplot(leader_table, main="Racial/ethnic Breakdown of Canopy School Leadership Teams",
        xlab="Percentage Breakdown", ylab="Number of Schools")
barplot(teacher_table, main="Racial/ethnic breakdown of Canopy school teaching teams",
        xlab="Percentage Breakdown", ylab="Number of Schools")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
