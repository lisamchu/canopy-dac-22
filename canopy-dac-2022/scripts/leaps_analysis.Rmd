# Leap Associations with Demographics  

## Model 1
The first model uses centered leap variable to show association between school characteristics and leap variables. This plot is useful for considering what information each leap variable revealed about schools with respect to some of the characteristics of the school, and perhaps, in which places it offered us very little information.

```

The plot below shows the association between school characteristics and each leap variable. In other words, it assumes change based on average statistics--average population and distribution for each variable.

```{r model 1 plot}
mod_1_plot
```


## Model 2 

The second model uses a logistic regression model to indicate the likelihood of schools to select each given leap as a function of specific variables, e.g., student racial population and socioeconomic status. Specifically, I used the percentage of Black students, Hispanic students, locale, as well as free/reduced price lunch percent, students with disabilities percent, and percent of English learners.  

Similar to the plot above, this plot details the absolute effects for each demographic variable listed above assuming average statistics--that is, an average population and distribution for each specified variable. Unlike the plot above, it shows how likely schools were to select the given leap based on this demographic rather than observing the effect as standard deviation.

This might be a slightly more interpretable plot to gather information from as a result.
