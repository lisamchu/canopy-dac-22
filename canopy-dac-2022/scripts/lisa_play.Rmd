## File Setup

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r import libraries}
library(here)
library(rio)
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(dplyr)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(scales)
library(poliscidata)
library(stringr)
library(reshape2)
library(lubridate)
```

## Data Cleaning

```{r data import}
tags <- read.csv(" ")
```

Next, we want to make sure the variable names are clean and consistent. This code makes the variable names lowercase and words separated by underscores.
```{r clean names}
tags <- tags %>% 
  clean_names()
```


## Data Analysis

Cycle 1 task: Where are schools innovating? Which states are represented or not? How many schools per state?
```{r state frequency}
statetable <- table()
